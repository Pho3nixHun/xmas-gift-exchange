# üéÑ Christmas Gift Exchange App

A modern React TypeScript application for organizing Christmas gift exchanges with beautiful animations and Christmas theming.

## ‚ú® Features

- **Loading Screen**: Displays interesting Christmas facts while initializing
- **User Authentication**: Password-protected user identification with local storage
- **Gift Box Selection**: Interactive animated gift box selection interface
- **Wishes Management**: Write and manage your Christmas wishes
- **Christmas Animations**: Snowfall effects, glowing elements, and smooth transitions
- **Responsive Design**: Works on desktop and mobile devices
- **Data Persistence**: Saves data to external API with local storage for user preferences

## üöÄ Technologies Used

- **React 18** with TypeScript
- **Framer Motion** for animations
- **TailwindCSS** for styling
- **Lucide React** for icons
- **JSONBin.io** for data persistence

## üì± User Flow

1. **Loading Screen**: Shows Christmas facts while app initializes
2. **Login**: User selects their name and optionally sets/enters password
3. **Gift Selection**: Choose from available gift boxes (each represents a person)
4. **Wishes**: Write and save Christmas wishes for their Secret Santa

## üõ†Ô∏è Development

### Prerequisites
- Node.js (v14 or higher)
- npm or yarn

### Installation
```bash
npm install
```

### Running the App
```bash
npm start
```

### Building for Production
```bash
npm run build
```

## üéÅ How It Works

1. **Data Structure**: The app uses the same data structure as the original Angular app:
   - `names`: Available participants and who they can pick
   - `taken`: Already selected name assignments
   - `gifts`: User wishes/gift requests
   - `passwords`: Optional password protection

2. **User Flow Logic**:
   - If user has localStorage data and already picked someone ‚Üí go to wishes screen
   - If user exists but hasn't picked ‚Üí go to selection screen  
   - Otherwise ‚Üí go to login screen

3. **Password Protection**: Users can optionally set passwords to protect their wishes

## üé® Design Features

- **Christmas Theming**: Red, green, and gold color scheme
- **Animated Backgrounds**: Falling snowflakes on all screens
- **Glass Morphism**: Translucent panels with backdrop blur
- **Smooth Transitions**: Framer Motion animations between screens
- **Interactive Elements**: Hover effects, loading states, and micro-interactions

## üîß Configuration

The app connects to the same JSONBin.io endpoint as the original Angular version. The API configuration is in `src/services/api.ts`.

## üìù Notes

This React version maintains the same core functionality as the original Angular app while adding enhanced Christmas theming, animations, and a more modern user interface.
